# MultiDirectional-Pedestrian-Detection-and-Counter

This project leverages the YOLOv8 pre-trained model to detect and count pedestrians walking in multiple directions. It aims to provide accurate pedestrian data that can be used in various applications such as:
--> Transportation Engineering: Enhancing traffic management systems and pedestrian safety.
--> Urban Planning: Designing better sidewalks, crosswalks, and overhead bridges based on pedestrian movement patterns.
By capturing and analyzing pedestrian data, this project serves as a valuable tool for creating smarter, more efficient urban infrastructure.
